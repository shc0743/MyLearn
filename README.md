## About `../../resource/tool.h`
Many of my projects use the `../../resource/tool.h` file. However, this file may not be included in some repositories, which could cause confusion. To clarify, `tool.h` is a collection of utility functions. You can find the source code in the [resource/](https://github.com/shc0743/MyLearn/tree/main/resource) directory.

## About Code Signing
As an in-board student, I cannot afford an official code-signing certificate. To provide some level of identification, I sometimes sign binary files using a self-signed certificate. The hash of the root certificate(s) is as follows:

```

```

# License
The general license for these projects is [LGPL-3.0](./LICENSE.md). However, some projects may use different licenses as specified in their respective repositories.
